Abstract / Introduction

The objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using historical health data. While the original intent was to use IBM Watsonx Studio's AutoAI feature, due to technical limitations in the platform, the same methodology and ML pipeline were replicated manually using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

## Features

- Interactive Streamlit web app for heart disease prediction
- Uses a trained machine learning model and scaler
- User-friendly input form
- Displays prediction result in real-time

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- joblib


## How to Run the App Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
